# FESG-Engine

This project is an extension of ESG-Engine project. The Featured ESG, feature ESG, core ESG notions and both full and incremental test sequence composition are implemented under this project. You can do the followings by using this project: 

- Convert a Featured ESG to JSON, CSV or DOT files. 
- Create a Full-ESG from a Featured ESG.
- Apply Incremental Test Sequence Composition by exploiting Feature-based Incremental Product Graph.
- Create test scenarios from the feature model of an SPL. 
- Try different testing scenarios on different SPL cases. 
- Reduce features from full products' ESGs to have different product configurations with the help of the FESGs.
